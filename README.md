# resque-uniq

A Resque plugin to ensure only one job instance is queued or running at a time.

Requires Redis 2.6 or newer.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'resque-uniq'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque-uniq

## Usage

Make your job class extend `Resque::Plugins::UniqueJob`, like this

    class BigJob
      extend Resque::Plugins::UniqueJob  # <--- add this line
      @queue = :big_job

      def self.perform
        # ...
      end
    end

## How it works

_resque-uniq_ associates a unique lock with each job instance being enqueued. A lock is a simple Redis _key/value_ pair.
The key name is derived uniquely from the job class name and job args. The value is `Time.now.to_i`. If the lock already
exists a new job instance is not enqueued. If not a new lock is created and a job is enqueued. The lock is removed after
its job's `perform` method has finished.

There is another lock, called _run lock_, which is being held during the execution of `perform` method. Before enqueuing
a new job instance, _resque-uniq_ checks if there is any orphaned _run lock_. This way it can detect if Resque workers
have crashed during job execution and left behind stale locks.

You can tell _resque-uniq_ to auto-expire job locks by setting `@unique_lock_autoexpire`

    class BigJob
      extend Resque::Plugins::UniqueJob
      @queue = :big_job
      @unique_lock_autoexpire = 6 * 3600   # TTL = 6 hours

      def self.perform
        # ...
      end
    end

Lock autoexpiration was necessary to protect against stale locks. With the new run lock trick you probably don't need it anymore.

If you want to define a default `unique_lock_autoexpire` in the base class and let other jobs to extend that base class
you cannot use `@unique_lock_autoexpire` since it's not inherited by subclasses. Define a class method with the same
name instead

    class BaseJob
      extend Resque::Plugins::UniqueJob

      def self.queue
        :default_queue
      end

      def self.unique_lock_autoexpire
        600 # TTL = 10 minutes
      end
    end

    class SmallJob < BaseJob
      def self.perform
        ...
      end
    end

    class BiglJob < BaseJob
      def self.unique_lock_autoexpire
        3 * 3600  # TTL = 3 hours
      end

      def self.perform
        ...
      end
    end

_resque-uniq_ requires Redis 2.6 (or newer) because it uses [Lua scripting](http://redis.io/commands/EVAL "Lua scripting") for some atomic operations.

## Credits

There are several similar Resque plugins. We tried them all but for one reason or another they didn't work reliably
for us. Therefore we wrote our own version. Nonetheless we would like to thank the authors of those plugins for inspiration.
